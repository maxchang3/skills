# Getting Started

There are two ways to leverage the power of AI inside your extensions.

{% hint style="info" %}
To use AI APIs or AI Extensions, you need to subscribe to [Raycast Pro](https://raycast.com/pro).

AI Extensions aren't available on Windows for now.
{% endhint %}

## AI APIs

Use our [AI APIs](/api-reference/ai.md) to generate content such as summaries, translations, and more. For example, the [Notion extension](https://raycast.com/notion/notion) uses `AI.ask(...)` as part of its Quick Capture command to generate a summary of a website.

## AI Extensions

Create an [AI Extension](/ai/create-an-ai-extension.md) to enable natural language interactions in Quick AI, AI Chat, and AI Commands. For example, the [Linear extension](https://www.raycast.com/linear/linear) allows you to manage your team's issues or check your personal priorities by simply chatting to it.
