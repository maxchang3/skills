# Keyboard

The Keyboard APIs are useful to make your actions accessible via the keyboard shortcuts. Shortcuts help users to use your command without touching the mouse.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the [Common shortcuts](#keyboard.shortcut.common) whenever possible to keep a consistent user experience throughout Raycast.
{% endhint %}

## Types

### Keyboard.Shortcut

A keyboard shortcut is defined by one or more modifier keys (command, control, etc.) and a single key equivalent (a character or special key).

See [KeyModifier](#keyboard.keymodifier) and [KeyEquivalent](#keyboard.keyequivalent) for supported values.

#### Example

```typescript
import { Action, ActionPanel, Detail, Keyboard } from "@raycast/api";

export default function Command() {
  return (
    <Detail
      markdown="Let's play some games 👾"
      actions={
        <ActionPanel title="Game controls">
          <Action title="Up" shortcut={{ modifiers: ["opt"], key: "arrowUp" }} onAction={() => console.log("Go up")} />
          <Action
            title="Down"
            shortcut={{ modifiers: ["opt"], key: "arrowDown" }}
            onAction={() => console.log("Go down")}
          />
          <Action
            title="Left"
            shortcut={{ modifiers: ["opt"], key: "arrowLeft" }}
            onAction={() => console.log("Go left")}
          />
          <Action
            title="Right"
            shortcut={{ modifiers: ["opt"], key: "arrowRight" }}
            onAction={() => console.log("Go right")}
          />
          <Action title="Open" shortcut={Keyboard.Shortcut.Common.Open} onAction={() => console.log("Open")} />
        </ActionPanel>
      }
    />
  );
}
```

#### Properties

| Property                                    | Description                                 | Type                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| key<mark style="color:red;">\*</mark>       | The key of the keyboard shortcut.           | [`Keyboard.KeyEquivalent`](#keyboard.keyequivalent) |
| modifiers<mark style="color:red;">\*</mark> | The modifier keys of the keyboard shortcut. | [`Keyboard.KeyModifier`](#keyboard.keymodifier)`[]` |

If the shortcut contains some "ambiguous" modifiers (eg. `ctrl`, or `cmd`, or `windows`), you will need to specify the shortcut for both platforms:

```js
{
  macOS: { modifiers: ["cmd", "shift"], key: "c" },
  Windows: { modifiers: ["ctrl", "shift"], key: "c" },
}
```

### Keyboard.Shortcut.Common

A collection of shortcuts that are commonly used throughout Raycast. Using them should help provide a more consistent experience and preserve muscle memory.
