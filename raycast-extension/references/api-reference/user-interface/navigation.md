# Navigation

## API Reference

### useNavigation

A hook that lets you push and pop view components in the navigation stack.

You most likely won't use this hook too often. To push a new component, use the [Push Action](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/user-interface/pages/-MiwANRaRK1jG1WJw3dy#action.push). When a user presses `ESC`, we automatically pop to the previous component.

#### Signature

```typescript
function useNavigation(): Navigation;
```

#### Example

```typescript
import { Action, ActionPanel, Detail, useNavigation } from "@raycast/api";

function Ping() {
  const { push } = useNavigation();

  return (
    <Detail
      markdown="Ping"
      actions={
        <ActionPanel>
          <Action title="Push" onAction={() => push(<Pong />)} />
        </ActionPanel>
      }
    />
  );
}

function Pong() {
  const { pop } = useNavigation();

  return (
    <Detail
      markdown="Pong"
      actions={
        <ActionPanel>
          <Action title="Pop" onAction={pop} />
        </ActionPanel>
      }
    />
  );
}

export default function Command() {
  return <Ping />;
}
```

#### Return

A [Navigation](#navigation) object with [Navigation.push](#navigation) and [Navigation.pop](#navigation) functions. Use the functions to alter the navigation stack.

## Types

Return type of the [useNavigation](#usenavigation) hook to perform push and pop actions.
