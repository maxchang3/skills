# Review an Extension in a Pull Request

Learn how to review a contribution from a Pull Request opened by a contributor.

All updates to an extension are made through a [Pull Request](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/pulls) - if you need to review whether the Pull Request works as expected, then you can checkout the fork within a few seconds.

## Steps

1. Open a terminal window
2. Navigate to a folder where you want the repository to land
3. Run the below commands

*There are a few things you'll need to find and insert manually in the snippet below*

**FORK\_URL**

Open the PR and click on the incoming ref as shown below

![](https://2922539984-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-Me_8A39tFhZg3UaVoSN%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-1a66bb065c6f9ccb78f4a42eebdcd3c70837fb1d%2Fgo-to-ref.webp?alt=media)

Now click the code button and copy the HTTPS path from the dropdown

**BRANCH**

You can see the branch on the above image (in this example it’s `notion-quicklinks`)

**EXTENSION\_NAME**

Click the `Files Changed` tab to see in which directory files have been changed (in this example it’s `notion`)

```
BRANCH="ext/soundboard"
FORK_URL="https://github.com/pernielsentikaer/raycast-extensions.git"
EXTENSION_NAME="soundboard"

git clone -n --depth=1 --filter=tree:0 -b ${BRANCH} ${FORK_URL}
cd raycast-extensions
git sparse-checkout set --no-cone "extensions/${EXTENSION_NAME}"
git checkout
cd "extensions/${EXTENSION_NAME}"
npm install && npm run dev
```

4. That's it, the extension should now be attached in Raycast
