# CLI

The CLI is part of the `@raycast/api` package and is automatically installed in your extension directory during setup. To get a list of the available CLI commands, run the following command inside your extension directory:

```bash
 npx ray help
```

## Build

`npx ray build` creates an optimized production build of your extension for distribution. This command is used by our CI to publish your extension to the store.

You can use `npx ray build -e dist` to validate that your extension builds properly.

## Development

`npx ray develop` starts your extension in development mode. The mode includes the following:

* Extension shows up at the top of the root search for quick access
* Commands get automatically reloaded when you save your changes (you can toggle auto-reloading via Raycast Preferences > Advanced > "Auto-reload on save")
* Error overlays include detailed stack traces for faster debugging
* Log messages are displayed in the terminal
* Status indicator is visible in the navigation title of the command to signal build errors
* Imports the extension to Raycast if it wasn't before

## Lint

`npx ray lint` runs [ESLint](http://eslint.org) for all files in the `src` directory.

## Migrate

`npx ray migrate` [migrates](/misc/migration.md) your extension to the latest version of the `@raycast/api`.

## Publish

`npx ray publish` verifies, builds, and publishes an extension.

If the extension is private (eg. has an `owner` and no public `access`), it will be published to the organization's private store. This command is only available to users that are part of that organization. Learn more about it [here](/teams/getting-started.md).
