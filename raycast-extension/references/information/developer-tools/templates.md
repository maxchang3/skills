# Templates

Raycast provides a variety of templates to kickstart your extension.

Raycast provides 3 types of templates:

* **Commands:** These are templates for [commands](/information/terminology.md).
* **Tools:** These are templates for [tools](/information/terminology.md#tool). You can select a different one for each tool that you add to your extension.
* **Extension Boilerplates:** These are fully built extensions designed to be tweaked by organizations for internal use.
