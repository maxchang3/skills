# OAuth Utils

Dealing with OAuth can be tedious. So we've built a set of utilities to make that task way easier. There are two part to our utilities:

1. Authenticating with a service using [OAuthService](/utilities/oauth/oauthservice.md) or built-in providers (e.g GitHub with `OAuthService.github`)
2. Bringing authentication to Raycast commands using [withAccessToken](/utilities/oauth/withaccesstoken.md) and [`getAccessToken`](/utilities/oauth/getaccesstoken.md)

`OAuthService`, `withAccessToken`, and `getAccessToken` are designed to work together. You'll find below different use cases for which you can use these utils.

## Using a built-in provider

We provide built-in providers that you can use out of the box, such as GitHub or Linear. You don't need to configure anything for them apart from the scope your extension requires.

```tsx
import { Detail, LaunchProps } from "@raycast/api";
import { withAccessToken, getAccessToken, OAuthService } from "@raycast/utils";

const github = OAuthService.github({
  scope: "notifications repo read:org read:user read:project",
});

function AuthorizedComponent(props: LaunchProps) {
  const { token } = getAccessToken();
  return <Detail markdown={`Access token: ${token}`} />;
}

export default withAccessToken(github)(AuthorizedComponent);
```

You can see our different providers on the following page: [OAuthService](/utilities/oauth/oauthservice.md)

## Using your own client

```tsx
import { OAuth, Detail, LaunchProps } from "@raycast/api";
import { withAccessToken, getAccessToken, OAuthService } from "@raycast/utils";

const client = new OAuth.PKCEClient({
  redirectMethod: OAuth.RedirectMethod.Web,
  providerName: "Your Provider Name",
  providerIcon: "provider_icon.png",
  providerId: "yourProviderId",
  description: "Connect your {PROVIDER_NAME} account",
});

const provider = new OAuthService({
  client,
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  scope: "YOUR_SCOPES",
  authorizeUrl: "YOUR_AUTHORIZE_URL",
  tokenUrl: "YOUR_TOKEN_URL",
});

function AuthorizedComponent(props: LaunchProps) {
  const { token } = getAccessToken();
  return <Detail markdown={`Access token: ${token}`} />;
}

export default withAccessToken(provider)(AuthorizedComponent);
```

## Using `onAuthorize` to initialize an SDK or similar

This example is useful in cases where you want to initialize a third-party client and share it throughout your codebase.

```tsx
import { OAuthService } from "@raycast/utils";
import { LinearClient, LinearGraphQLClient } from "@linear/sdk";

let linearClient: LinearClient | null = null;

export const linear = OAuthService.linear({
  scope: "read write",
  onAuthorize({ token }) {
    linearClient = new LinearClient({ accessToken: token });
  },
});

export function withLinearClient<T>(Component: React.ComponentType<T>) {
  return withAccessToken<T>(linear)(Component);
}

export function getLinearClient(): { linearClient: LinearClient; graphQLClient: LinearGraphQLClient } {
  if (!linearClient) {
    throw new Error("No linear client initialized");
  }

  return { linearClient, graphQLClient: linearClient.client };
}
```
